# Project 1 - *Simple To Do Application*

**To Do List** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Janet Zulu**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart



I would love to add feautures that would allow the user to personalize the app

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
When creating the app, the only challanged I faced was getting used to Kotlin because I am used to Java. It was a fun learning experience.
